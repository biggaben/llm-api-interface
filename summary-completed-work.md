Here's a summary of the work completed for the LLM API Interface project:

1. **Project Structure**
```
llm-api-interface/
├── core/
│   ├── models/
│   │   ├── config.py     # Model configurations and types
│   │   └── manager.py    # Model selection and management
│   ├── api/
│   │   └── client.py     # API client for model interactions
│   └── security/
│       └── keys.py       # API key management
├── tests/
│   └── unit/
│       └── test_api_client.py
├── environment.yml       # Conda environment config
└── pytest.ini           # Test configuration
```

2. **Core Components Implemented**:
   - Model Manager
     - Support for CLAUDE, GPT4O, and O1_PREVIEW models
     - Intelligent model selection based on task type
     - Cost tracking and budget management
     - Usage metrics

   - API Client
     - Async/await design
     - Streaming support
     - Error handling
     - Rate limit handling
     - Support for both Anthropic and OpenAI APIs

   - Security
     - API key management
     - Environment variable integration

3. **Testing Infrastructure**:
   - Comprehensive unit tests
   - Mock responses and streaming
   - Async test support
   - Error case coverage
   - 12 test cases covering all major functionality

4. **Environment Setup**:
   - Python 3.12
   - Conda environment management
   - Key dependencies:
     - aiohttp for async HTTP
     - pytest and pytest-asyncio for testing
     - python-dotenv for configuration

Would you like to:
1. Implement additional components (CLI, caching, etc.)?
2. Add more comprehensive documentation?
3. Set up CI/CD pipeline?
4. Work on another aspect of the system?
